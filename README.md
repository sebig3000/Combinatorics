# Combinatorics

Collection of methods to generate combinatorics patterns like combinations
& permutations.
For sets java.util.Set is used, for multisets or ordered arrangements
java.util.List is used.

The methods are named by the following pattern:
(partial)Combination/Permutation(Rep)(N)
 - Partial: the result hold less elements than the initial set (omitted for
combination because a non-partial combination is the initial set).
 - Combination: combinations of the initial set are generated.
 - Permutation: permutations of the initial set are generated.
 - Rep: elements can be in the result more than once
 - N: doesn't generate any patterns but calculates the number of patterns
that will be generated by the corresponding method

## Usage

All methods are placed in the class Combinatorics and are static.
The methods should be, with the documentation comments, self-explanatory.
